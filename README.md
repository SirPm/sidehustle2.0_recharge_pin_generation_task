# sidehustle2.0_recharge_pin_generation_task First Task

## I've given the user the ability to select the number of digits they want present in the recharge card pin based on the condition given that it should be at least 12 characters long
## Hence if the inputed digit is less than 12 it'll throw an error telling the user what is wrong

## Also because the condition given was to generate at least 200 recharge pins I also gave the user the ability to select the number but the least they can select is 200 otherwise it'll throw an error
